# Instructions to Use the App

## Home Screen
When users land on the site, they’ll be greeted by the home screen. There is a navigation menu at the top where users have the option to log in or go to a game. There is a description of the game, as well as an example of how to play. Users will have the option to ‘Play Now!’. 

## Navigation Menu
On each page, users have a navigation menu at the top right corner. From there, they will see links that lead to Home, Login, or Game. If users are logged in, they will also see a Dashboard link, as well as a Logout link.

## Login Modal
When users click on the navigation menu and then select ‘Login’, they will be shown the login modal, where they can login to a pre-existing account by providing the correct credentials associated with said account. 

## Signup Modal
When users click on the navigation menu and then select ‘Login’ and then ‘Create an account’ at the bottom of the login modal, they will be shown the signup modal, where they can create an account by inputting a valid username, email, and password.

## Graph Menu Page
When users click on the navigation menu and then select ‘Game’ (regardless of whether they are logged in or not), users will be redirected to the graph menu page, where they can choose from many possible puzzles.

## Graph Game  
After selecting a puzzle from the graph menu page, users get redirected to the graph game page. Each puzzle is a diagram of interconnected nodes. Users have to type in positive whole numbers in each node such that each node’s number is the sum of the digits of all the numbers connected to it. Users are also timed on how long they take to correctly complete the puzzle.

If the user finds they cannot solve the puzzle, they can click ‘Get Solution’ and get the solution for the puzzle.

When users are finished filling out all nodes with valid values, they can click ‘Submit Solution’ to see whether they are correct. They will see a message based on whether their solution is correct/incorrect. They will also get options based on the correctness of their solution to continue onto the next game or go back to the menu page or the landing page.

## User Dashboard
When users click on the navigation menu while they’re logged in and then select ‘Dashboard’, if they are a user, they will be redirected to the user dashboard, where they can view their account settings and gameplays.

## Admin Dashboard
When admins click on the navigation menu while they’re logged in and then select ‘Dashboard’, if they are an admin, they will be redirected to their dashboard, where they can view their account settings and their admin features such as user account removal and password reset.
