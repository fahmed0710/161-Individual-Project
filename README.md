# Digit-Sum-Graphs

## PART A: Project Basics
**Full Name**: Fariha Ahmed

**Project Title**: Digit Sum Graphs

**Project Description**: The user is given a diagram of interconnected nodes. One node will have a number in it. The user must fill the other nodes with positive whole numbers in such a way that each node's number is the sum of the digits of all the numbers connected to it.

## PART C: Milestones
All milestones are moving parts and are subject to refinement.

**M1 (2/6 - 2/16)**: Finalize Design + Features

**M2 (2/16 - 2/29)**: Database Setup + User and Admin Account Implementation

**M3 (3/1 - 3/30)**: Game Implementation

**M4 (3/30 - 4/10)**: Game Metrics Display for Users and Admin

**M5 (4/11 - 4/16)**: Testing


## PART D: Technologies
**Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind

**Backend**: Flask, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker


## PART E: Algorithms
**Generating answers**: A backtracking algorithm will be used to generate all the possible answers for a given node. For each connected node that hasn't been assigned a value yet, a positive whole number will be assigned to it. All possible assignments will be recursively explored and made sure that the sum equals the value of the node it's connected to. If a solution is found where all filled with valid numbers, it will be added to a list of possible solutions. Other possible assignments will be tried after backtracking, until all options are exhausted. 


## PART F: Market Space & Selling Points
The game is geared towards people of all ages of any kind. However, math-oriented people and puzzle-lovers are more likely to consistently engage with the game over time. 

The game is simple enough in the sense that the directions are very straightforward and there's not much the user has to do, but still challenging enough for users to be engaged. There will be a few levels, so the game will not become redundant and users can progress onto more difficult problems if they want something more challenging.

With this game, users can flex their problem solving and logic skills, as well as practicing their math skills through the constant additions needed to solve the problems.
